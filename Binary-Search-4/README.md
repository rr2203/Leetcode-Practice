## Problem1 
Intersection of Two Arrays II (https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays-ii/)




## Problem2
Median of Two Sorted Arrays (https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays)



Output:
[[2,1]]

Explanation:
There are only three combinations [1,1],[2,1],and [3,1], which have a total of 4000, 6000, and 8000 miles, respectively. Since 6000 is the largest use that does not exceed 7000, [2,1] is the optimal pair.
